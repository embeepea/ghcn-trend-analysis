# GHCN Trend Analysis

This project contains the Clojure code I wrote when doing the data
analysis for the
[US Temperature Trend Map](http://github.com/embeepea/us-temperature-trend-map).

I did this as a learning exercise in using Clojure for data analysis,
and I did all the work in an interactive Clojure REPL.  Unfortunately
the code is not in a form that allows the analysis to be done
automatically --- it's just a collection of funcions that I wrote
while using the REPL interactively to generate the final data file for
the project.

The project uses [Leiningen](leiningen.org); to launch the repl, clone
the repo and run `lein repl`.
